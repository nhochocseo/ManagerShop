# How to use Filter, FilterAndPaging API
More formally:
* `sorts` is a comma-delimited ordered list of property names to sort by. Adding a `-` before the name switches to sorting descendingly.
* `filters` is a comma-delimited list of `{Name}{Operator}{Value}` where
    * `{Name}` is the name of a property with the Entity attribute or the name of a custom filter method for TEntity
        * You can also have multiple names (for OR logic) by enclosing them in brackets and using a pipe delimiter, eg. `(LikeCount|CommentCount)>10` asks if `LikeCount` or `CommentCount` is `>10`
    * `{Operator}` is one of the [Operators](#operators)
    * `{Value}` is the value to use for filtering
        * You can also have multiple values (for OR logic) by using a pipe delimiter, eg. `Title@=new|hot` will return posts with titles that contain the text "`new`" or "`hot`"
* `page` is the number of page to return
* `pageSize` is the number of items returned per page 
* `includes` is the relationship of Entity returned, You can get 2 relationship with commas

Notes:
* You can use backslashes to escape commas and pipes within value fields
* You can have spaces anywhere except *within* `{Name}` or `{Operator}` fields
